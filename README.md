## progress

- the basic idea is to have a pass to optimize affine -> mpi, starting with
a basic partition (A+B) in two ranks, processing a half of the data on each
process

## tasks

- clean mlir-tutorial code []
- create a basic pass using cpp mechanism []
- update basic version with more ranks (e.g., -n-ranks=10) []
